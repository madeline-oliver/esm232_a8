# Develop your performance metric

Our metric is BIAS or Percent Error (Err). We'll be calculating average percent error for the whole dataset.

```{r}
# 1. Code metric as a function
source("err.R")
source("nse.R")

# read in data
sager = read.table("sager.txt", header=T)
head(sager)

msage = read.table("sagerm.txt", header=T)
head(msage)

```

```{r}
# clean multiple model results streamflow data in sagerm.txt

# add date from the existing columns of day, month, year
sager = sager %>%
  mutate(date=make_date(year=year, 
                        month=month,
                        day=day))

# each column in msage is streamflow for a different parameter set

# lets say we know the start date from our earlier output
msage$date = sager$date
head(msage)
msage$month = sager$month
msage$year = sager$year
msage$day = sager$day
msage$wy = sager$wy

# and we still have observed data from above
# useful to combine by date to make sure that streamflow and observe match

msage$obs = sager$obs

# how can we plot all results
# to turn all the columns of different outputs into a single column identified by "run"
msagel = msage %>% gather(key="run",value="streamflow", -date, -month, -day, -year, -wy, -obs)

plot <- ggplot(subset(msagel, wy == 1970), aes(as.Date(date), streamflow, col = run)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
plot

# 2. Apply performance metric to the streamflow data provided in sagerm
res = msage %>% 
  select(-date, -month, -day, -year, -wy, -obs) %>% 
  map_dbl(~err(m=.x, o=msage$obs))

res
summary(res)

```

```{r}
source("check_minannual.R")
# if we want to keep track of which statistics is associated with each run, we need a unique identifies
# a ID that tracks each model output - lets use the column names
simnames = names(msage %>% select(-date, -month, -day,-year,-wy, -obs))
results = cbind.data.frame(simnames=simnames, err=res)
# another example using our low flow statistics
# use apply to compute for all the data
res = msage %>% 
  select(-date, -month, -day, -year, -wy, -obs ) %>% 
  map_dbl(~check_minannual(o=msage$obs,
                           month=msage$month,
                           day=msage$day,
                           year=msage$year, 
                           wy=msage$wy, 
                           m=.x))
# add to our results
results$minannual_cor = res
```


```{r}
# 3. Find the simulation that gives the best performance (record that and add to the quiz on gauchospace)
summary(results)

```
Simulation 100.1  has the minimum number for Err.


```{r}
# 4. Create a boxplot of your metric applied to sagerm.txt

ggplot(results, aes(err)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Err") +
  theme_minimal()

# min(results$simnames)

```
